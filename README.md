## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
This project was only tested on **Ubuntu 20.04**, so it is **highly recommended** to only use it on these distributions, **please make a restore point before trying this (nothing should happen but you never know).**

This script is not a definitive way to install Cairo 1.0, as there is currently no documentation source I tried to save people a few steps in the way that worked for me. NO need to run with sudo

## How to use
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/sdgalvan/cairo-installer.git
```
2. Go to the installer.sh folder
```
cd cairo-installer
```
3. Run installer.sh with cairo version 

The supported versions are the following:

| [Cairo Releases](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/releases/)  | Parameter |

- [dpinoness](https://github.com/dpinones): for showing me how the installation process was, I simply based myself on those steps to automate this, the credit belongs to him. Also the base project is from their [Exploring Cairo 1.0](https://github.com/dpinones/exploring-of-cairo-1) repository ü§£ (next step if you want to learn more about syntax).
